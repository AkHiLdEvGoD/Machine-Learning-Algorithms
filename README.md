# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repo contains Machine Algoritmhs build from scratch using Raw Python and Numpy.
Additionally Scikit-learn library is used to import **Datasets** for training and testing.

## Implemented Algorithms 
- Gradient Descent on Linear Regression (Batch, Stochastic and Mini batch) 
- Perceptron Trick and Logistic Regression
- Regularization on Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machine (Classifier)
- K-Nearest Neighbour (Classifier)
- Adaboost
- Gradient Boosting (Classifier and Regressor)
